The more stress and strain, the greater the need for sleep and other forms of recovery. Sleep is also impaired by night work, late habits, alcohol, smoking and physical inactivity. Other factors that can negatively affect sleep are light, noise and high temperature where you sleep. Poor sleep can often be significantly improved through regular physical activity, reduced stress, and regular sleeping habits.\r\n\r\nPlease consider:\r\n<ul><li>Do I get enough good sleep so that I feel rested when I am awake?</li><li>What do I need to change to make my sleep better?</li></ul>",

  "hea.questionStressOverallDescriptionLong": "Perceived stress affects health and well-being. Through physical activity, sleep and recovery, you can reduce your perceived stress. Having a lot to do does not automatically mean that you feel stressed. How we experience a situation depends on both our biological conditions and previous experiences. What one person experiences as stressful, another may find stimulating. Low physical activity and poor fitness can cause you to experience stress to a greater extent. The risk of burnout syndrome arises if the stress reaction is prolonged and recovery is insufficient. Valuable recovery during the working day is to make time for lunch and coffee breaks and to regularly stand up and move for a short while.\r\n\r\nExamples of causes of stress can be a feeling of lack of time and inadequacy, a lack of balance between work and leisure, financial insecurity, conflicts/illness in the family and always being reachable and connected. At work, a high workload, little opportunity for influence, lack of social support, conflicts, poor leadership, irregular working hours and insecurity in the work situation can also play a role.\r\n\r\nIf you experience a lot of stress, it may be helpful to consider:\r\n<ul><li>What is it that I do in everyday life and at work, that I don't really want to/have to do and that I can refrain from?</li><li>Can more exercise, improved diets, more recovery, or better sleep habits make it easier to deal with the stress I'm experiencing?</li><li>How can I improve the balance between work, family and a meaningful/active leisure time?</li></ul><b>references</b>\r\nDo you get sick from stress?

Both the number of red blood cells and the total blood volume affect how much oxygen is transported. The hemoglobin content for women is 120–155 grams per liter of blood and for men 130–170 grams. The total blood volume is 4–4.5 liters in women and 5–6 liters in men.\n\nRegular cardiovascular exercise results in a significant increase in plasma and a slight increase in the number of red blood cells, which together increase the blood volume by 10–15 percent or more.</p>",

This means that exercise with only moderate intensity (= 50 % of max) still utilizes the heart's maximal stroke volume and therefore improves the heart's capacity. 1-2 months of regular exercise at moderate intensity can increase the heart´s stroke volume by about 20 percent or more. A trained heart with a higher stroke volume does not have to beat as often to pump out the same volume.

  "health-account-profile-halu.questionBloodPressureResultDescriptionLong": "Increased blood pressure in a single measurement does not mean a high blood pressure diagnosis. The increased blood pressure may be due to stress or nervousness and should therefore be measured more than once. \n\nA healthy lifestyle contributes to normal blood pressure. Examples of a healthy lifestyle is to:\n• Exercise regularly and avoid being sedentary\n• Have a healthy weight and good diet with a low salt intake\n• Have a limited alcohol intake and not smoke.  \n\nHigh blood pressure is considered one of the most common diseases and is also called hypertension.\n\n<b>References</b>\nHere you can find general information about blood pressure:\nBlodtrycket.

  "health-account-profile-halu.questionBmiDescriptionLong": "BMI shows the relationship between weight and height by dividing the weight (kg) by the height (m) in square. BMI only takes into account height and weight and doesn't show if you have a high weight because of a greater proportion of muscles or if you have a high weight due to a greater proportion of fat. A physical fit person with a high muscle mass and less fat can have a BMI of 27 without being overweight. Conversely, physical inactive person with a low muscle mass and more fat may prove to be normal. Of course, pregnant women should also not use BMI.\n\nBMI works better at group level to see, for example, how a group, organization, or larger population develops. For example, from a public health perspective, we can see that the proportion of overweight and obesity in the western world has increased in recent decades.",

  "health-account-profile-halu.questionDietDescriptionLong": "Your diet should be set in relation to your energy needs and your goals, for example, if you exercise hard or want to change your weight. Think about how the meals are distributed throughout the day, the meals content, total calorie intake in relation to energy requirements, the amount of \"empty calories\", fluid intake and cooking methods. In general, regularity and variety are recommended as well as a large proportion of vegetables and fruits. \n\nIf you want to change your diet, it may be helpful to first think about: \n• Is my weight healthy? \n• How physically active I am during a normal day? \n• Do I get symptoms like tiredness or energy problems during the day? \n• Do I often crave something sweet? \n• Do I need to improve my diets for health reasons?\n \n<b>References</b>\nOfficial recommendations with a scientific background about good diet is presented in: \nNordiska Näringsrekommendationer.

The need for sleep varies with different people and the life situation. Most people consider that 6-8 hours of sleep are sufficient. However, the need is greater among young people and less in the elderly.\n\nThe most common cause of bad sleep is stress. The more stress and strain, the greater the need for sleep and other recovery. Sleep is also deteriorated by night work, late habits, alcohol, smoking and physical inactivity. Other factors that can adversely affect sleep are light, noise and high temperatures where you sleep. Poor sleep can often be significantly improved by regular physical activity, reduced stress and regular sleep habits.\n\nConsider:\n• Do I get enough good sleep, so I feel rested when I am awake?\n• What do I need to change to make my sleep better?\n\n<b>References</b>\nÅkerstedt T.

Regular cardiovascular exercise increases the heart's ability to pump out blood and increases the ability of the muscle to absorb oxygen and release energy. A healthy maximal oxygen uptake is at least 35 ml/min/kg and higher level can provide further health benefits.\n\nCardiovascular exercise is carried out with at least moderate intensity which is somewhat hard and makes you slightly breathless. Further improvement is obtained with higher intensity. It is important to adapt the exercise for your circumstances and level. For a new exerciser it is better to start with moderate intensity, which is sufficient enough to promote health. Keep in mind that the best exercise is the one that you actually do.\n\n<strong>References</strong>\nRead about the scientifically background to the strong correlation about maximal oxygen uptake and health, illness and mortality in:\nBlair SN m fl.

Risk of fatigue syndrome occurs if the stress response is prolonged and the recovery is insufficient. Valuable recovery during the working day is to give yourself time for lunch and coffee breaks and to regularly stand up and move for a short while.\r\n\r\nExamples of causes of stress can be a sense of lack of time and inadequacy, lack of balance between work and spare time, financial insecurity, conflicts/sickness in the family and always being reachable and connected. At work, high workload, little opportunity for influence, lack of social support, conflicts, bad leadership, irregular working hours and job insecurity can also play a role.\r\n\r\nf you experience a lot of stress, it may be helpful to consider:\r\n<ul><li>What am I doing in everyday life, which I really do not want to/must do and which I can refrain from?</li><li>Can more physical activity, improved diet, more recovery or better sleep habits make it easier to deal with the stress I experience?</li><li>How can I improve the balance between work, family and meaningful/active spare time?</li></ul><strong>References</strong>\r\nBlir man sjuk av stress?

Physical inactivity and low physical are correlated to more stress. \n\nJust as recovery is central in life, recovery is also important during the working day. It is important to have time for lunch, coffee breaks or to just stand up and move a short while. Risk of burnout occurs if the stress response is prolonged and the recovery is insufficient.\n\n<b>References</b>\nTheorell T. Psykosocial miljö och stress. Studentlitteratur, 2016.",

Regular physical activity can relieve aches and pains, counteract tiredness and reduce anxiety and depression.\n\nLong-term sedentary, awkward postures and physical inactivity can lead to back and neck issues. Both digestive system issues and tiredness can be caused by, among other things, stress, insufficient sleep, lack of recovery, wrong diet and physical inactivity. Stress, physical inactivity and lack of social relations can lead to depression or anxiety, which is becoming increasingly common in Sweden. \n\nPlease think about:\n• Could there be any correlation between my symptoms and my lifestyle?\n• Can a change in my lifestyle reduce my symptoms or is other measures required? \n\n<b>References</b>\nGeneral information about various symptoms can be found at Vårdguiden www.1177.se",

The listed frequencies are the ones that are most easily damaged if you are exposed to high noise levels. When you compare with previous values, it is good to remember that the comparison value will change with your age.",
  "health-account-profile-hex.questionHearingThresholdsAverageDescriptionLong": "The most common cause of hearing loss is age, followed by noise-induced damage. Noise-induced damage occurs when loud sounds overload the hearing, causing damage to the cells of the inner ear. The damage may subside after hours to weeks, or it may be permanent for the rest of one's life. The risk of noise-induced damage depends on how loud the sound is, as well as how long and how often one is exposed to it. According to the WHO's threshold, sound levels of 90 decibels should meet the ear for a maximum of 30 minutes per day. This is the same sound level as a lawnmower or a loud restaurant — or the level that many people have in their headphones. If you're curious about the level of noise you're surrounded by, there are free noise meters available for download to your mobile phone, for example, from the Swedish Work Environment Authority.\r\n\r\nThe susceptibility to noise-induced damage varies among individuals. Currently, we have no methods to determine who is sensitive or resilient to noise. That's why it's crucial that if exposed to noise, regular measurements should be conducted to detect early signs of hearing damage. Always report hearing impairments related to noise exposure to the Social Insurance Agency for determination of occupational injury and thus registration in occupational injury statistics and potential entitlement to compensation.\r\n\r\nConsider how you protect your hearing from loud noises.\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Do you use earmuffs or earplugs when in a high-noise environment? You should protect your ears if the noise level is so high that normal conversation is not possible. This is important both at work and during leisure time. You can find more information about hearing protection at the Swedish Work Environment Authority.</li><li>Do you set the volume to a reasonable level when listening to music? Remember not to increase the volume gradually.</li></ul>",

The more stress and strain, the greater the need for sleep and other recovery. Sleep is also deteriorated by night work, late habits, alcohol, smoking and physical inactivity. Other factors that can adversely affect sleep are light, noise and high temperatures where you sleep. Poor sleep can often be significantly improved by regular physical activity, reduced stress and regular sleep habits.\r\n\r\nPlease consider:\r\n<ul><li>Do I get enough good sleep, so I feel rested when I am awake?</li><li>What can I change to make my sleep better?</li></ul>",

  "health-account-profile-hex.questionStressLifeDescriptionLong": "Experienced stress affects health and well-being. Through physical activity, sleep and recovery you can reduce your experienced stress. Having a lot to do does not automatically mean that you feel stressed. How we experience a situation depends both on our biological conditions and past experiences. What one person experiences as stressful may be stimulating to another.\r\n\r\nPhysical inactivity and low physical fitness are correlated to more stress. Risk of fatigue syndrome occurs if the stress response is prolonged and the recovery is insufficient. Valuable recovery during the working day is to give yourself time for lunch and coffee breaks and to regularly stand up and move for a short while.\r\n\r\nExamples of causes of stress can be a sense of lack of time and inadequacy, lack of balance between work and spare time, financial insecurity, conflicts/sickness in the family and always being reachable and connected. At work, high workload, little opportunity for influence, lack of social support, conflicts, bad leadership, irregular working hours and job insecurity can also play a role.\r\n\r\nf you experience a lot of stress, it may be helpful to consider:\r\n<ul><li>What am I doing in everyday life, which I really do not want to/must do and which I can refrain from?</li><li>Can more physical activity, improved diet, more recovery or better sleep habits make it easier to deal with the stress I experience?</li><li>How can I improve the balance between work, family and meaningful/active spare time?</li></ul><strong>References</strong>\r\nBlir man sjuk av stress?

Regular cardiovascular exercise increases the heart's ability to pump out blood and increases the ability of the muscle to absorb oxygen and release energy. A healthy maximal oxygen uptake is at least 35 ml/min/kg and higher level can provide further health benefits.\n\nCardiovascular exercise is carried out with at least moderate intensity which is somewhat hard and makes you slightly breathless. Further improvement is obtained with higher intensity. It is important to adapt the exercise for your circumstances and level. For a new exerciser it is better to start with moderate intensity, which is sufficient enough to promote health. Keep in mind that the best exercise is the one that you actually do.\n\n<b>References</b>\nRead about the scientifically background to the strong correlation about maximal oxygen uptake and health, illness and mortality in:\nBlair SN m fl.

A healthy maximal oxygen uptake is at least 35 ml/min/kg and higher level can provide further health benefits.\n\nCardiovascular exercise is carried out with at least moderate intensity which is somewhat hard and makes you slightly breathless. Further improvement is obtained with higher intensity. It is important to adapt the exercise for your circumstances and level. For a new exerciser it is better to start with moderate intensity, which is sufficient enough to promote health. Keep in mind that the best exercise is the one that you actually do.\n\n<b>References</b>\nRead about the scientifically background to the strong correlation about maximal oxygen uptake and health, illness and mortality in:\nBlair SN m fl.

How we experience a situation depends both on our biological conditions and past experiences. What one person experiences as stressful may be stimulating to another.\r\n\r\nPhysical inactivity and low physical fitness are correlated to more stress. Risk of fatigue syndrome occurs if the stress response is prolonged and the recovery is insufficient. Valuable recovery during the working day is to give yourself time for lunch and coffee breaks and to regularly stand up and move for a short while.\r\n\r\nExamples of causes of stress can be a sense of lack of time and inadequacy, lack of balance between work and spare time, financial insecurity, conflicts/sickness in the family and always being reachable and connected. At work, high workload, little opportunity for influence, lack of social support, conflicts, bad leadership, irregular working hours and job insecurity can also play a role.\r\n\r\nf you experience a lot of stress, it may be helpful to consider:\r\n<ul><li>What am I doing in everyday life, which I really do not want to/must do and which I can refrain from?</li><li>Can more physical activity, improved diet, more recovery or better sleep habits make it easier to deal with the stress I experience?</li><li>How can I improve the balance between work, family and meaningful/active spare time?</li></ul><strong>References</strong>\r\nBlir man sjuk av stress?

The need for sleep varies between different people and their life situation. Most people consider 6-8 hours of sleep to be sufficient. However, the need is greater among young people and less among the elderly.\r\n\r\nThe most common cause of poor sleep is stress. The more stress and strain, the greater the need for sleep and other forms of recovery. Sleep is also impaired by night work, late habits, alcohol, smoking and physical inactivity. Other factors that can negatively affect sleep are light, noise and high temperature where you sleep. Poor sleep can often be significantly improved through regular physical activity, reduced stress, and regular sleeping habits.\r\n\r\nPlease consider:\r\n<ul><li>Do I get enough good sleep so that I feel rested when I am awake?</li><li>What do I need to change to make my sleep better?</li></ul>",

  "hpb.questionStressOverallDescriptionLong": "Perceived stress affects health and well-being. Through physical activity, sleep and recovery, you can reduce your perceived stress. Having a lot to do does not automatically mean that you feel stressed. How we experience a situation depends on both our biological conditions and previous experiences. What one person experiences as stressful, another may find stimulating. Low physical activity and poor fitness can cause you to experience stress to a greater extent. The risk of burnout syndrome arises if the stress reaction is prolonged and recovery is insufficient. Valuable recovery during the working day is to make time for lunch and coffee breaks and to regularly stand up and move for a short while.\r\n\r\nExamples of causes of stress can be a feeling of lack of time and inadequacy, a lack of balance between work and leisure, financial insecurity, conflicts/illness in the family and always being reachable and connected. At work, a high workload, little opportunity for influence, lack of social support, conflicts, poor leadership, irregular working hours and insecurity in the work situation can also play a role.\r\n\r\nIf you experience a lot of stress, it may be helpful to consider:\r\n<ul><li>What is it that I do in everyday life and at work, that I don't really want to/have to do and that I can refrain from?</li><li>Can more exercise, improved diets, more recovery, or better sleep habits make it easier to deal with the stress I'm experiencing?</li><li>How can I improve the balance between work, family and a meaningful/active leisure time?</li></ul><b>references</b>\r\nDo you get sick from stress?
